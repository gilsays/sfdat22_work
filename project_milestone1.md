Idea #1
Determining the likelyhood of a traffic accident on a freeway (specifically 580 going into San Francisco)
There are several data sets available, but finding the right source (i.e. timeframe, location, and details) may be the challenge.
Examples of a dataset below:

Thought of this idea on a commute traveling into SF for work and how certain dates are just regular delays, and some are longer due to accidents.
It would be interesting to see likelyhood of a accident in time of day with various metrics to help with understanding when to leave for work.

Idea #2
Understanding how much inventory should be ordered for products based on seasonality, promotions, and life on floor.
Data available from work, with historical going back to 2012. 
Various metrics are available, Initial Buy, Sell Through, Promotion Cadence, Seasonality, and Reg Weeks are a few metrics.
Inventory management is a constant issue in the retail fashion world and thought it be an interesting issue to tackle.

Idea #3
Predicting if a style will be purchased online based on its product image.
Data available from work. Metrics available with Click through rate, conversion rate, and actual image of products.
Current and past exeperiences, I have seen creative for products/product image can change the conversion rate dramatically.
Initial understanding of the best way to create the image can help save a lot of money and rework.
